\section{Introduction}

Strokes are a major health concern globally, recognized as one of the leading causes of disability and death. Occurring when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, it can lead to significant physical, cognitive, and emotional impairments in affected individuals. \cite{kaur2022retracted} The impact of strokes extends beyond the individual, affecting families and communities, and placing a substantial strain on healthcare systems. With the rising incidence of strokes associated with aging populations and the increasing prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, there is an urgent need to focus on effective stroke prevention strategies. Prevention requires a multifaceted approach that includes public education, early identification of risk factors, and lifestyle modifications. Simple changes, such as adopting a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and managing underlying health conditions, can greatly reduce an individual's risk of stroke. Moreover, healthcare providers must play an active role in raising awareness about stroke prevention and ensuring that at-risk patients receive appropriate screenings and interventions. By promoting a comprehensive understanding of stroke risk factors, we can empower individuals to take charge of their health. This proactive approach not only aims to reduce the frequency of strokes but also facilitates overall public health awareness, fostering healthier communities. As advances in knowledge and strategies for stroke prevention, we can work towards a future where strokes are less frequent and their consequences are minimized \cite{sirisha2021awareness}.

\subsection{Define the Problem and Goals of This Capstone Project} 
This section discusses the goals of the proposed project. The primary focus of this capstone project is to develop a comprehensive understanding of stroke prediction and prevention strategies using data-driven approaches. Main goal consist of identifying key risk factors. By applying statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, it will determine which variables are most predictive of stroke occurrence. Further focus will evaluate performance of developed models in predicting stroke events, thereby providing valuable insights for early intervention. The project will propose targeted preventive strategies that can be implemented in community health programs therefore enhancing greater public awareness.

\section{Literature Review and Background Research}
Numerous studies have identified effective preventive measures for reducing the risk of stroke, emphasizing both management of hypertension and lifestyle interventions. Hypertension is the most significant modifiable risk factor for stroke, and studies have shown that controlling blood pressure through lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, regular physical activity, reducing sodium intake, smoking cessation, and adhering to prescribed antihypertensive medications can significantly lower the likelihood of experiencing a stroke. Maintaining blood pressure within a normal range (typically less than 120/80 mmHg) is crucial in preventing both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, making it the most critical focus in stroke prevention efforts. Combined, these research findings underscore the importance of a multifaceted approach to stroke prevention that integrates medical treatment with proactive lifestyle changes.
