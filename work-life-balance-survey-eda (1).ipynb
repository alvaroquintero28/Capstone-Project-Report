Data extraction from Google Sheet and preparation\n","\n","2. Exploratory Analysis\n","    - Healthy body\n","    - Healthy mind\n","    - Expertise\n","    - Connection\n","    - Meaning\n","\n","### In summary\n","The key take-away for each of the five areas are the following:\n","1. Our **BMI** is most influenced by a quality nutrition (fruits/Vegetables) and physical activity (daily steps)\n","2. Key influencers of our **stress level** are our ability to concentrate on our work during flow sessions, daily meditation and the sufficiency of our income.\n","3. Those of us who **achieve the most remarkable things**, have also maximized our productivity (completing our daily todo list), focus on our activities (flow sessions) and have earnt multiple personal awards and recognition.\n","4. Having a **core circle of family members and close friends** influences the amount of new places we visit (discovery), reduces our daily stress and improve our social connections outside of this core circle.\n","5. We find **more time for passion** when we complete well our daily todo list (personal productivity), flow through the day and have obtained many personal awards and recognition.\n","\n","### Check other Kaggle notebooks from [Yvon Dalat](https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat):\n","* [Titanic, a step-by-step intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat/titanic-a-step-by-step-intro-to-machine-learning): **a practice run ar EDA and ML-classification**\n","* [HappyDB, a step-by-step application of Natural Language Processing](https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat/happydb-what-100-000-happy-moments-are-telling-us): **find out what 100,000 happy moments are telling us**\n","* [Work-Life Balance survey, an Exploratory Data Analysis of lifestyle best practices](https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat/work-life-balance-best-practices-eda): **key insights into the factors affecting our work-life balance**\n","*  [Work-Life Balance survey, a Machine-Learning analysis of best practices to rebalance our lives](https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat/work-life-balance-predictors-and-clustering): **discover the strongest predictors of work-life balance**\n","\n","**Interested in more facts and data to balance your life, check the [360 Living guide](https://amzn.to/2MFO6Iy) ![360 Living: Practical guidance for a balanced life](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EhntLIyBL.jpg)**\n","\n","# 1.
